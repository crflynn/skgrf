## Forest implementations

- [x] Regressor
- [x] Quantile regressor
- [x] Survival forest
- [x] Local linear regressor
- [ ] Probability forest (waiting on new release)
- [x] Causal forest
- [x] Instrumental forest
- [x] Boosted regressor
- [ ] Causal survival forest (waiting on new release)


## Considerations

What should we do with respect to tuning? sklearn has search CV for tuning, whereas grf has its own tuning implementation.
